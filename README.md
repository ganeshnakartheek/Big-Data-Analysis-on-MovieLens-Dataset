# Big-Data-Analysis-on-MovieLens-Dataset

MovieLens itself is a research site run by GroupLens Research group at the University of Minnesota. The first automated recommender system was developed there in 1993.

The movieLens dataset is most often used for the purpose of recommender systems which aim to predict user movie ratings based on other users ratings. 

In other words we expect that users with similar taste will tend to rate movies with high correlation.

The MovieLens Dataset is available in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).
